This is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper **"PGDT: A Physics-Guided Dual-Teacher Framework for Semi-Supervised SAR Ship Detection"** 

## 💡 Introduction
Existing semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods are prone to self-reinforcing errors in SAR imagery due to their homogeneous network architectures and confirmation bias. 

To mitigate this, we propose the **Physics-Guided Dual-Teacher (PGDT)** framework. Distinct from conventional ensembles, PGDT establishes a heterogeneous expert system:
- **Semantic Teacher**: A data-driven branch for high-level contextual abstraction.
- **Physics Teacher**: A parameter-free expert leveraging IS-Transform for objective scattering validation.
- **Dual-Arbitration Mechanism**: Employs an adaptive curriculum schedule, synergistically utilizing *Physics Veto* to prune clutter-induced false positives and *Physics Mining* (with *Teacher-Guided Refinement*) to retrieve stealthy targets.

## Usage

### Requirements

Ensure your local environment meets the following specifications before installation:

- `Ubuntu 24.04`
- `CUDA=12.4`
- `Anaconda3` with `python=3.8`
- `PyTorch=2.0+` (Please ensure the `pytorch-cuda=11.8` matches your local driver)
- `MMDetection=3.3.0`
  
## Installation
```text
make install
```
## 📂 Data 
We evaluate PGDT on the **SSDD** and **HRSID** datasets. Please download the datasets and organize them in the `data/` folder as follows:
```text

  └── data/
      ├── SSDD/
      │   ├── annotations/
      │   │   ├── instances_train_5percent.json
      │   │   ├── instances_train_10percent.json
      │   │   ├── instances_unlabeled_95percent.json

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Training
To train the PGDT model on a single GPU, select the config file based on your desired dataset and labeled data ratio (5% or 10%):

**For HRSID (10% Labeled):**
```shell
python tools/train.py configs/pgdt/pgdt_faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_10percent_hrsid.py
```
*Note: To train with 5% labeled data, simply replace `10percent` with `5percent` in the command above.*

**For SSDD (10% Labeled):**
```shell
python tools/train.py configs/pgdt/pgdt_faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_10percent_ssdd.py
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model on the test set:
```shell
python tools/test.py configs/pgdt/pgdt_faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_10percent_hrsid.py work_dirs/pgdt_faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_10percent_hrsid/latest.pth
```
